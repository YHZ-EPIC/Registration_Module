- Added all Necessary Packages and Installed them (Frontend Backend Root) : Exactly as Traversy Media
- Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4AhvYORZRY
- Configuration or URI done in env File at Root Folder
- Lets focus on creating Backend & Database First (Send and Retrieve Data using Postman etc)
- Frontend Bilkul End Pe XD

- api/users = Register -> POST
- api/users/auth = Auth -> POST
- api/users/logout = Logout -> POST
- api/users/profile = Get User Profile -> GET
- api/users/profile = Update User Profile -> PUT
- api/users/delete = Delete User Profile -> DELETE (I added it)

--> Backend Completed (CRUD) with basic Auth
--> Now Frontend (Can be built using anything React, Svelte, Vue blah blah, Backend API will just serve data to whomever requests it)
